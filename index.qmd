## Goals

My name is Sophie Walton, and I'm a first year PhD student. Right now, I'm focused on developing my proposal and the skills I need to execute it.

## Education

I received my undergraduate degree in Biology from Bowdoin College and my Master's degree in Education from Rhode Island College.

## Experience

I conducted an honors thesis at Bowdoin on engertic tradeoffs in mussels due to predator stress. For the past four years, I worked a science teacher.
